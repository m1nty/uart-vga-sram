<a name="objective"></a>
### Objective

To gain experience with self-checking testbenches. To design a digital system synchronized to a video graphics array (VGA) interface and an external static random access memory (SRAM). To understand how the universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) works. To transmit image files from the personal computer (PC) to the DE2-115 board, where they are stored, processed and displayed.
